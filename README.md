# Express-Shop

## Overview

Express-Shop is a web application project built using Express.js with EJS as the templating engine. The aim of this project was to challenge myself to create a fully functional web shop within 8 hours of real-time coding, tracked using WakaTime. While the project is currently unfinished, I managed to make significant progress within the given timeframe.
